#Android Police's Send To -> Watermark

Hi.

This is an image manipulation tool for Android Police. It'll add an "AP Watermark" entry to the Windows Send To menu for easy compression and watermarking of images. It is mostly a pretty wrapper around parts of ImageMagick.

This will create a copy of the image in the current folder, prefix "wm_" to the file name, set the max width to 1680px, compress it a bit, and add the AP watermark. Your original image will not be touched.

##Installation
Run Setup.exe.

##Basic Usage
Right click a picture, hover over "Send to", and hit "AP Watermark."
