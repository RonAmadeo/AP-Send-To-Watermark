#Android Police's Send To -> Watermark

Hi.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/RonAmadeo/AP-Send-To-Watermark/raw/master/resources/readme/What-this-will-do.jpg"/></p>

This is an image manipulation tool for <a href="http://androidpolice.com">Android Police</a>. It'll add an "AP Watermark" entry to the Windows Send To menu for easy compression and watermarking of images. It is mostly a pretty wrapper around parts of ImageMagick.

This will create a copy of the image in the current folder, prefix "wm_" to the file name, set the max width to 1680px, compress it a bit, and add the AP watermark. Your original image will not be touched.

##Installation
Run \setup\Setup.exe.

##Basic Usage
Right click a picture, hover over "Send to", and hit "AP Watermark." It supports multiple files too.
